# Wisconsin App

For our HCI project, we had to redesign a system. My team and I picked the UW - Madison's App as it was not very user-friendly.
We redesigned the Bus and Event features adhering to the HCI Design Principles and using techniques like Contextual Inquiring, Rapid Prototyping, Design Ethnography, 
Qualitative Data Analysis to create low fidelity and high fidelity prototypes in order to improve the content, user interface, and performance.
